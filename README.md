## About

**Babel Tower** is a free and open-source application designed specifically for real-time text translation in multilingual games and media content. With this system, you can fully enjoy games and entertainment across different languages without being hindered by language barriers.

This software utilizes **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** technology combined with the **Google Translate API** to achieve real-time translation functionality, and requires an internet connection to operate. Since all features are implemented using online APIs, the software does **not install any third-party programs** on your computer, nor does it **modify any game files**. As long as subtitles appear on the screen‚Äîwhether in games or videos‚Äîthis software can recognize and translate them.

‚ö†Ô∏è **‚Äª Note: This system uses the [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?hl=en) API, which may incur fees. Please evaluate carefully before use.**

## ‚ú® Features Overview

### üñ•Ô∏è Main Interface

![Main Interface](github_image/main-window.png)

<img src="github_image/ui_icons/add_capture_window.png" alt="Open Capture Window" height="28" style="border: 1px solid gray;">

1. **Open the Capture Window:**  
   After opening, drag the window over the subtitle area you want to translate and resize it appropriately. (It is recommended not to select irrelevant areas to avoid affecting recognition and translation.)

   - <img src="github_image/ui_icons/bright_ui_icon.png" alt="Icon Highlighted" height="28">  
     When the Capture Window is open, this button stays highlighted.  
     If the window gets lost, press the button again to bring the Capture Window to the top of all windows.

4. **Enable or disable window pinning:**  
   By default, this feature is enabled. When activated, the main interface stays pinned on top of all windows.  
   If the Capture Window is also open, they will be synchronized.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Page

- **Text**

  ![Settings - Text](github_image/settings-text.png)

  - Adjust the **font size** and **font color** for the recognition and translation results displayed on the main interface.

- **Capture**

  ![Settings - Capture](github_image/settings-capture.png)

  - Adjust the screen capture frequency (i.e., the OCR recognition interval). The default is **Standard (2 seconds)**.
  - **Recommended capture intervals:**
    - If subtitles appear **character by character**, it is recommended to set the interval to **3 seconds or longer**.
    - If full sentences appear at once, adjust the interval based on the subtitle display speed.
  - **Auto Resume After Screenshot:**  
    When enabled, after you use the screenshot function during screen capture mode, the system will automatically countdown 5 seconds and resume the previous capture mode.  
    If disabled, you must manually restart the capture mode after taking a screenshot.  
    This option is **disabled by default**.

    ![Auto Resume After Screenshot](github_image/auto-recapture.png)

- **System**

  ![Settings - System](github_image/settings-system.png)

  - In this tab, you can configure your **Google credential file**.  
    After selecting the credential file you've applied for, it will be copied to the application's directory.  
    This configuration is **persistent** and will be checked every time the application starts.
  - If the existing credential becomes invalid, you can update it here.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** In the Windows version, if you're using multiple monitors, the screenshot area is limited to the monitor where the application main interface is located.

### üìù Screenshot Translation Explanation

- Since the system cannot determine whether the screenshot contains a **full sentence** or **multiple options**, it will display both types of translation results.

- **Case 1: Option-style text** ‚Äî see the top portion of the result.
  ![Screenshot Explanation 1](github_image/screenshot-explain-image01.png)

- **Case 2: Full sentence** ‚Äî see the bottom portion of the result.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. **Is this application safe? How does it work?**

   - This application uses the **Google Cloud Vision API** for OCR and the **Google Cloud Translation API** for translation.
   - It does not install any additional software on your system ‚Äî you can use it with confidence.
   - All source code is publicly available on [GitHub]().

2. **On macOS, why do I get an error saying the app is "damaged and can‚Äôt be opened"?**

   - This is due to macOS security mechanisms. Even if the app is safe, macOS may block execution of unverified software and show the message:  
     **‚ÄúXXX is damaged and can‚Äôt be opened. You should move it to the Trash.‚Äù**
   - To resolve this issue, follow the guide here:  
     [Mr. MAD - How to Fix "File Damaged" Error on macOS Ventura 13](https://mrmad.com.tw/macos-ventura-file-corrupted)

3. **Which languages does this app support for recognition?**

   - As long as the language is supported by **Google Cloud Vision API**, it can be recognized.  
     Most major languages in the world are supported.

4. **Can the app translate into languages other than Traditional Chinese?**

   - Currently, the translation output is fixed to **Traditional Chinese**.  
     Custom translation target language is **not yet supported**.

5. **Why doesn't the app window stay on top?**

   - Make sure the application you're translating is running in **windowed mode**, not **full-screen mode**.

6. **Why isn't the entire subtitle being recognized?**

   - The app uses **Google Cloud Vision API** to detect text on screen.  
     To reduce unnecessary API calls, it compares the similarity between the current and previous screenshots to avoid redundant recognition.
   - If your subtitles appear **one character at a time** instead of full sentences, it's recommended to set the capture interval to **3 seconds or more**.  
     This reduces the chance of the system thinking the screen hasn't changed and skipping OCR.

7. **How do I delete the app's configuration files if I no longer want to use it?**

   - **macOS:** Simply drag the entire app to the Trash.
   - **Windows:** Go to `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents` and delete the `Babel Tower` folder.

## Changing Translated Target Langauage

If you want to change the translated target language to the one you prefer, go to `main.py` and change below code:
